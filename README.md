# Covid-19-Data-Analysis
CONTEXT: 
The COVID-19 pandemic was caused by the emergence and global spread of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. 
The virus likely originated in bats and might have been transmitted to humans through an intermediate host 
species, possibly at a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the early cases were initially identified in late 2019. 
The exact origins are still under investigation.SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets 
when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. It can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the 
virus and then touching the face. The virus has a relatively high transmission rate, contributing to its rapid spread 
worldwide. 
The global nature of modern travel facilitated the virus's swift international transmission, leading to a pandemic. 
As the virus spread, various countries implemented measures such as lockdowns, social distancing, and travel 
restrictions to contain its transmission. The lack of pre-existing immunity to the novel virus, combined with its 
ability to cause a range of symptoms from mild to severe, posed significant challenges for public health systems 
globally, contributing to the scale and impact of the pandemic.
